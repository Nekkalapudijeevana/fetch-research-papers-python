# PubMed Pharma Papers Fetcher\n\nThis is a command-line tool to fetch research papers from PubMed and identify those with authors affiliated with pharmaceutical or biotech companies.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable):\n    ```bash\n    # Assuming you have a git repository\n    # git clone <repository_url>\n    # cd pubmed-pharma-papers\n    ```\n    *(Note: In this notebook environment, the files are created directly, so cloning is not needed.)*\n\n2.  **Install dependencies using Poetry:**\n    ```bash\n    poetry install\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe tool provides a command-line interface `get-papers-list` to fetch papers.\n\n```bash\nget-papers-list <query> [options]\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n*   `<query>`: The PubMed search query string (e.g., `"cancer immunotherapy"`). This is a required positional argument.\n\n**Options:**\n\n*   `-f <filename>`, `--file <filename>`: Specify an output CSV filename. If not provided, results will be printed to the console.\n*   `-d`, `--debug`: Enable debug output for more detailed information during the fetching process.\n*   `--year <year1> [<year2> ...]`: Filter results by one or more publication years.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   Fetch papers for "cancer immunotherapy" and print to console:\n    ```bash\n    poetry run get-papers-list "cancer immunotherapy"\n    ```\n    or (after `poetry install` and `poetry shell`)\n    ```bash\n    get-papers-list "cancer immunotherapy"\n    ```\n\n*   Fetch papers for "drug discovery" and save to `results.csv`:\n    ```bash\n    poetry run get-papers-list "drug discovery" --file results.csv\n    ```\n\n*   Fetch papers for "gene therapy" from years 2023 and 2024 with debug output:\n    ```bash\n    poetry run get-papers-list "gene therapy" --year 2023 2024 -d\n    ```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   `cli.py`: The main command-line interface script that uses `argparse` and calls the fetching logic.\n*   `pubmed_pharma_papers/`: The Python package containing the core logic.\n    *   `pubmed_pharma_papers/pubmed_fetcher.py`: Contains the `fetch_pubmed_data` function for interacting with the PubMed API.\n    *   `pubmed_pharma_papers/__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.\n*   `pyproject.toml`: Poetry configuration file, including dependencies and the script entry point.\n*   `README.md`: This file, providing project information and usage instructions.\n\n## Contributing\n\n*(Optional section - add details if you plan to accept contributions)*\n
